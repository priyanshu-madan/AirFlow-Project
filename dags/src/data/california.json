The California Health Equity Metric is designed to help guide counties in their continuing efforts to reduce COVID-19 cases in all communities and requires more intensive efforts to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among Californians who have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic.\r\n\r\nPlease see https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx for more information.\r\n\r\nAlso, in lieu of a Data Dictionary, please refer to the detailed explanation of the data columns in Appendix 1 of the above webpage.\r\n\r\nBecause this data is in machine-readable format, the merged headers at the top of the source spreadsheet have not been included:\r\n\r\n- The first 8 columns are under the header \"County Status as of Tier Assignment\"\r\n\r\n-  The next 3 columns are under the header \"Current Data Week Tier and Metric Tiers for Data Week\"\r\n\r\n-  The next 4 columns are under the header \"Case Rate Adjustment Factors\"\r\n\r\n-  The next column is under the header \"Small County Considerations\"\r\n\r\n-  The last 5 columns are under the header \"Health Equity Framework Parameters\"", "modified": "2020-11-17T02:47:14.274698", "accessLevel": "public", "identifier": "e19b8fba-7c04-495b-8e2f-90d041e1bb59", "landingPage": "https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx", "temporal": "2020", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "California Department of Public Health"}, "accrualPeriodicity": "R/P1W", "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "California Department of Public Health", "hasEmail": "mailto:OpenData@cdph.ca.gov"}, "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "format": "CSV", "title": "Blueprint Data Chart 11-16-20", "description": "&#42; Schools that have already re-opened if a county was in a less restrictive tier do not have to close.

The WIC Authorized vendors will use the CA Authorized Product List (APL) to transact WIC food items at the cash register. The WIC APL is a USDA mandated report critical to support the WIC EBT purchase. WIC EBT requires the vendor system to maintain the APL in order to match  the scanned food items' UPC to ensure they are on the WIC APL. The food items identified by UPC and PLU can be found in different tabs of the data file below.\r\n\r\nThe Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program is a federally-funded health and nutrition program that provides assistance to pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and children under age five. WIC helps California families by providing food benefits to individual participants based on their nutritional need and risk assessment.

Gestational age is based on obstetric estimate at delivery (OE). Data includes births with gestational age of 17-47 weeks.

WAC increase reports are submitted by prescription drug manufacturers to OSHPD within a month after the end of the quarter in which the current WAC increase went effective. Key data elements include the national drug code (NDC) maintained by the FDA; narrative descriptions of the reasons for the increase in WAC; and the five-year history of WAC increases. A WAC Increase Report consists of 27 data elements that have been divided into two Excel data sets: Prescription Drugs WAC Increases and Prescription Drugs WAC Increase \u2013 5 Year History. The data sets include manufacturer WAC Increase Reports received since January 1, 2018. The Prescription Drugs WAC Increases data set consists of the information prescription drug manufacturers submitted for data elements that pertain to the current WAC increase of a given report, including the amount of the current increase, the WAC after increase, and the effective date of the increase. The Prescription Drugs WAC Increase \u2013 5 Year History data set consists of the information prescription drug manufacturers submitted for the data elements that comprise the 5-year history of WAC increases of a given report, including the amount of each increase and their effective dates. The data sets include the data in completed reports submitted by manufacturers as of August 17, 2020 through the second quarter of 2020 and may include reports that do not meet the specified minimum thresholds for reporting.\r\n\r\nThe Quick Guide explaining how to link the information in each data set to form complete reports is here: https://oshpd.ca.gov/ml/v1/resources/document?rs:path=/Data-And-Reports/Documents/Topics/Cost-Transparency/Rx/QuickGuide_LinkingTheDatasets.pdf\r\n\r\nThe program regulations are available here: https://oshpd.ca.gov/ml/v1/resources/document?rs:path=/Data-And-Reports/Documents/SIERA-Resources/Drug-Pricing-Reports/CTRx-Regulations-Text.pdf\r\nThe data format and file specifications are available here: https://oshpd.ca.gov/ml/v1/resources/document?rs:path=/Data-And-Reports/Documents/SIERA-Resources/Drug-Pricing-Reports/CTRx-Data-Format-and-File-Specifications.pdf\r\n\r\nDATA NOTES: Due to recent changes in Excel capabilities, it is not recommended that you save these files to .csv format. If you do, when importing back into Excel the leading zeros in the NDC number column will be dropped. If you need to save it into a different format other than .xlsx it must be .txt\r\n\r\nDATA UPDATES: Annual datasets of reports from the preceding year are reviewed in the second half of the current year to identify if any revisions or additions have been made since the original release of the datasets. If revisions or additions have been found, an update of the datasets will be released. Datasets will be clearly marked with 'Updated' in their titles for convenient identification.

Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey included both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the survey, and 3) new methods were used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 \u2013 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond.

The infant mortality rate is regarded as a highly sensitive measure of population health because there is an association between the causes of infant mortality and other factors that influence the status of whole populations such as economic development, general living conditions, social well-being, rates of illness, quality and access to medical care, public health practices, and quality of the environment. The infant mortality rate is measured as the number of infant deaths before one year of age for every 1,000 live births in that population. About two-thirds of infant deaths occur before a baby is one month old, and the remaining third between two and 12 months of life.[2]\r\n\r\nInfant mortality is linked to women\u2019s health status with healthier moms having healthier babies. Considering nearly half of pregnancies are unplanned, it is critical for women to get healthy now. Women\u2019s health is multifaceted and includes good nutrition, reducing or quitting smoking, and avoiding excess alcohol use. Optimal health also includes managing stress, strong social support, education, economic stability, and being able to live in healthy neighborhoods for physical activity and community safety. Of course, being able to access high quality health care also matters.\r\n\r\nLearn more at [Let's Get Healthy California](https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/goals/healthy-beginnings/reducing-infant-mortality/)\r\n\r\n[1] March of Dimes.

Another performance measure in this dataset allows for tracking hospital progress in meeting established HAI reduction goals. Hospitals must have an SIR at or below incremental targets each year to be considered on track. California hospitals should achieve 30% reductions in SSI incidence from 2015 to 2020.\r\n\r\nNHSN calculates procedure-specific risk adjustment logistic regression models based on 2015 national baseline data and that accounts for particular patient-level factors and hospital characteristics found to be significant predictors of SSI incidence. The number of predicted infections generated from these models is used to calculate the SIR, a measure of HAI incidence, by dividing the number of actual observed infections by the number of predicted infections.\r\n\r\nDetailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest. \r\nFor more information about the SIR and NHSN\u2019s statistical models, please review the \u201cNHSN Guide to the SIR\u201d at https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ps-analysis-resources/index.html\r\n\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please refer to the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk\r\n\r\nFor more information about HAIs in California hospitals, please visit: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/AnnualHAIReports.aspx", "modified": "2020-05-18T18:15:06.369951", "accessLevel": "public", "identifier": "f243090b-4c05-4c61-b614-7cb49b86b21d", "landingPage": "https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/HAIProgramHome.aspx", "temporal": "2013-present", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "California Department of Public Health"}, "accrualPeriodicity": "R/P1Y", "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Center for Health Care Quality/Healthcare-Associated Infections Program/Epidemiology Unit", "hasEmail": "mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"}, "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "format": "CSV", "title": "SSI in Adult Patients, 2019", "description": "This table shows the surgical site infections (SSI) data for 28 operative procedures performed on adult patients in 2019 reported by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

CDPH publishes annual MRSA BSI data reported by each California hospital in the datasets below. \r\n\r\nThe following datasets include the number of MRSA BSI reported by each California hospital in the specified reporting year. Beginning in 2016 for each California hospital, the annual MRSA BSI dataset includes the number of MRSA BSI that were predicted to occur in each hospital based on its specific facility-level characteristics. The observed (reported) number of MRSA BSI are then compared to the predicted number of MRSA BSI in a ratio called the Standardized Infection Ratio or SIR. The SIR is a metric that summarizes an individual hospital\u2019s MRSA BSI prevention progress compared with the national baseline and California state-specific prevention goals. \r\n\r\nThe datasets also include the associated 95% confidence intervals for the SIR and statistical interpretation to show whether MRSA BSI incidence was the same (no different), better (lower) or worse (higher) than the national baseline. Another performance measure in this dataset allows for tracking hospital progress in meeting national HAI reduction goals.

"description": "This dataset includes central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data reported by California hospitals to the California Department of Public Health, Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Program, via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Hospital types include acute care, critical access, long-term acute care, free-standing rehabilitation hospitals, as well as acute rehabilitation units that report data separately.\r\n\r\nCLABSI data for each hospital include the number of infections observed (reported) and predicted (based on national baseline data), the number of central line-days, the Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) and associated 95% confidence intervals, and statistical interpretation to show whether CLABSI incidence was the same (no different), better (lower), or worse (higher) than the national baseline. Another performance measure in this dataset allows for tracking hospital progress in meeting national HAI reduction goals. Hospitals must have an SIR at or below incremental targets each year to be considered on track. California hospitals should achieve 50% reductions in CLABSI from 2015 to 2020. Central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent for each hospital is calculated from data reported by all critical care locations (i.e., critical care areas, neonatal critical care, and one special care area, \"Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care\").\r\n\r\nCLABSI SIRs are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and infection control maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance and reporting methods. Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(2) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CLABSI identified in their facilities. \r\n\r\nFor general information about NHSN, surveillance definitions, and reporting requirements for CLABSI, please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html \r\n\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, including OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk\r\n\r\nFor information about healthcare-associated infection prevention progress in California hospitals and statewide prevention goals, please visit: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/AnnualHAIReports.aspx", "modified": "2020-04-21T20:01:42.764078", "accessLevel": "public", "identifier": "9bfdb084-9ca5-46f5-8121-20a53d59bfca", "landingPage": "https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/HAIProgramHome.aspx", "temporal": "2013-present", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "California Department of Public Health"}, "accrualPeriodicity": "R/P1Y", "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "California Dept of Public Health, Center for Health Care Quality/Healthcare-Associated Infections Program/Epidemiology Unit", "hasEmail": "mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"}, "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "format": "CSV", "title": "CLABSI in Hospitals, 2019", "description": "This table shows the 2019 central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) data reported by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

The information collected allows CDPH and CDC to: 1) find out when and where influenza activity is occurring; 2) track influenza-related illness; 3) determine what influenza viruses are circulating; 4) detect changes in influenza viruses; and 5) measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths.", "modified": "2020-01-29T16:46:24.752847", "accessLevel": "public", "identifier": "fc544658-35c5-4be0-af20-fc703bc57c13", "landingPage": "https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/Influenza.aspx", "temporal": "Outpatient Influenza-like Illness: 2001-2002 through 2017-2018 influenza seasons. \r\nClinical Sentinel Laboratory and Public Health Laboratory: 2009-2010 through 2017-2018 influenza seasons", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "California Department of Public Health"}, "accrualPeriodicity": "R/P1Y", "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "California Department of Public Health/Center for Infectious Disease/Division of Communicable Disease Control/Immunization Branch/Vaccine Preventable Diseases Epidemiology Section", "hasEmail": "mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"}, "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "format": "CSV", "title": "Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Data by Region and Influenza Season", "description": "These data contain outpatient influenza-like illness surveillance data from volunteer sentinel providers by region and influenza season.", "downloadURL": "https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/fc544658-35c5-4be0-af20-fc703bc57c13/resource/e127a67b-cbf2-4ad5-ac82-9e5e2d12d3a6/download/flu-ili-byregion-fluseason.csv"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "format": "XLSX", "title": "Data Dictionary-Outpatient Influenza-like Illness", "downloadURL": "https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/fc544658-35c5-4be0-af20-fc703bc57c13/resource/be3e8fce-d47d-4bb8-8cb2-830f68209be5/download/datadictionary-outpatient-influenza-like-illness.xlsx"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "format": "CSV", "title": "Clinical Sentinel Laboratory Influenza and Other Respiratory Virus Surveillance", "description": "These data contain laboratory surveillance data for influenza and other respiratory viruses from volunteer sentinel clinical laboratories by region and influenza season.", "downloadURL": "https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/fc544658-35c5-4be0-af20-fc703bc57c13/resource/5b7cef59-c9e4-49eb-b97a-add09ab11be6/download/flu-clinicallab-byregion-fluseason.csv"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "format": "XLSX", "title": "Data Dictionary-Clinical Sentinel Laboratory Influenza", "downloadURL": "https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/fc544658-35c5-4be0-af20-fc703bc57c13/resource/becac4f2-e12f-498b-89e5-a5c1702f1b7a/download/data-dictoionary-clinical-laboratory-results-by-region.xlsx"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "format": "CSV", "title": "Public Health Laboratory Influenza Respiratory Virus Surveillance Data by Region and Influenza Season", "description": "These data contain laboratory surveillance data for influenza virus types, subtypes, and lineage types from public health laboratories in California by region and influenza season.", "downloadURL": "https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/fc544658-35c5-4be0-af20-fc703bc57c13/resource/063faf93-0572-4fdc-84cf-263f110dc09a/download/flu-publichealthlab-byregion-fluseason.csv"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "format": "XLSX", "title": "Data Dictionary-Public Health Laboratory Influenza Respiratory Virus Surveillance", "downloadURL": "https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/fc544658-35c5-4be0-af20-fc703bc57c13/resource/83776194-ad94-43fd-8929-b3be1fdc3a3c/download/data_dictionary-public_health_laboratory_surveillance.xlsx"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "format": "ZIP", "title": "All resource data", "downloadURL": "https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/fc544658-35c5-4be0-af20-fc703bc57c13/resource/96fb5413-c61b-428c-993d-953ead02ee9f/download/influenza-surveillance-rfdzrz.zip"}], "keyword": ["HMPV", "ILINet", "RSV", "VPD", "adenovirus", "coronavirus", "enterovirus", "flu", "flu season", "human metapneumovirus", "influenza", "influenza A subtype", "influenza B lineage type", "influenza season", "influenza type", "influenza-like illness", "laboratory surveillance", "parainfluenza virus", "respiratory syncytial virus", "rhinovirus"], "theme": ["Diseases and Conditions"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "title": "Vaccine Preventable Disease Cases by County and Year", "description": "These data contain counts of vaccine preventable disease cases among California residents by county, disease, and year.\r\n\r\nThe California Department of Public Health (CDPH) maintains a mandatory, passive reporting system for a list of communicable disease cases and outbreaks.

A cumulative ACEs score is calculated for each respondent by counting the number of these items that a respondent reported experiencing, creating a score ranging from 0 to 8.\r\n11 questions about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are condensed into a ordinal scale from 0 to 8 possible ACEs. This indicator shows the prevalence of adults who reported having 1 or more ACEs.

High rates may indicate concerns with low quality and are associated with high costs.[2] Fortunately, there is evidence that hospital readmission rates can be reduced using tested quality improvement methods.[3] Typically, these interventions involve system transformation. Coordinating care between in-patient, outpatient, home, and community settings is a key component of high quality health systems.[3]\r\n\r\nPatients\u2019 demographic and economic status, social support structure, and multiple health conditions can increase or decrease the likelihood of being readmitted; though these impacts are not fully understood.\r\n\r\nNote that this indicator is not risk-adjusted and differs in some ways from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) measure. Data are categorized by age, sex, race/ethnicity, expected payer source, and county of residence.
