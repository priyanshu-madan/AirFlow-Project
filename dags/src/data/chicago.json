The Chicago Park District partners with the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Public Health Laboratory to analyze water samples using a new DNA testing method called Rapid Testing Method (qPCR analysis) which tests for Enterococci in order to monitor swimming safety. \n \nThe rapid testing method (qPCR analysis) is a new method that measures levels of pathogenic DNA in beach water. Unlike the culture based test that requires up to 24 hours of processing, the new rapid testing method requires a 4-5 hours for results. The Chicago Park District can use results of the rapid test to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 1000* CCE. When DNA bacteria levels exceed 1000 CCE, a yellow swim advisory flag is implemented. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria (http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/criteria/health/recreation).\n \nHistorically, the Chicago Park District used the culture based analysis method and statistical prediction models to monitor beach water quality. \nThe culture based method tests for Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria which is an indicator species for the presence of disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoans that may pose health risks to the public. This method requires 18-24 hours of processing to receive results. The Chicago Park District would use results of the culture based method to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 235* CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented. This standard is still used at most beaches throughout the Great Lakes region. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria.\n \nThe statistical prediction model forecasted real-time Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria levels present in the water. The Chicago Park District (CPD) in partnership with the US Geological Survey, developed statistical prediction models by using weather data pulled from CPD buoys (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku) and weather stations (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75). The Chicago Park District would use results of the predictive model to notify the public when bacteria levels would exceed 235 CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented.\n \n* The unit of measurement for Escherichia coli is Colony Forming Units (CFU) per 100 milliliters of water. (Culture Based Method / Statistical Prediction Model)\n*The unit of measuring DNA is Enterococci Calibrator Cell Equivalents (CCE) per 100 milliliters of water.

Newer records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/sxs8-h27x. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

This dataset is historical-only.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \n\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\n\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of \u201cCompleted\u201d when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a \u201ccave-in\u201d or \u201cfailed utility cut\u201d, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor. \n\nData Owner: Transportation.

Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. As per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes.

If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management.

To make a request, please email dataportal@cityofchicago.org. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future.\n\nThe data is limited to adult arrests, defined as any arrest where the arrestee was 18 years of age or older on the date of arrest. The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). \n\nDepartment members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \n\nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\n\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: \u2022\tCODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County. If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore. They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. \u2022\tST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to. \u2022\tCREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council. Dates before 2003 do not relect the actual date passed. \r\n\r\nTo view or use these shapefiles, compression software, such as 7-Zip, and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS or QGIS, are required.

The major difference in this dataset is that the cases, deaths, and corresponding rates per 100,000 population are not those for the single date indicated. They are rolling averages for the seven-day period ending on that date. This rolling average is used to account for fluctuations that may occur in the data, such as fewer cases being reported on weekends, and small numbers.  The intent is to give a more representative view of the ongoing COVID-19 experience, less affected by what is essentially noise in the data.\r\n\r\nAll rates are per 100,000 population in the indicated group, or Chicago, as a whole, for \u201cTotal\u201d columns.\r\n\r\nOnly Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider.\r\n\r\nConfirmed cases are counted on the date the test specimen was collected. Deaths are those occurring among confirmed cases based on the day of death. Demographic data are based on what is reported by medical providers and is not verified by CDPH.\r\n\r\nDenominators are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimate for 2018 and can be seen in the Citywide, 2018 row of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa).\r\n\r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects cases and deaths currently known to CDPH.\r\n\r\nNumbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to definitions of COVID-19-related cases and deaths, sources used, how cases and deaths are associated to a specific date, and similar factors.\r\n\r\nData Source: Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System, Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey", "title": "COVID-19 Daily Rolling Average Case and Death Rates", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/columns.svc", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Health & Human Services"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/e6xh-nr8w", "issued": "2013-02-08", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2016-08-24", "keyword": ["business", "boundaries", "gis", "shapefiles", "kml", "kmz"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Jonathan Levy", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e6xh-nr8w", "description": "Current industrial corridors in Chicago.

The most recent estimates for each region are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

This data can also be used to look up your property's unique 6-digit Chicago Energy Benchmarking ID, which is required for compliance.

The law, which phases in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicago\u2019s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.\r\n\r\nNote that the ordinance authorizes the City to make individual building data readily-available to the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is covered. The Covered Buildings List is distinct from the publicly-shared energy use data, and does not include energy use or any other information reported in the benchmarking process. For the building-specific energy use dataset, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c.\r\n\r\nIf your property is on this list, and you do not believe you are covered by the ordinance, please submit the appropriate online exemption form at: www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking. If your property is not on the list, and it meets the compliance criteria, please check for any alternative building addresses. If the building is still not found, please submit the Building ID Request Form (http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/Benchmarking_ID_Request.html). The Chicago Energy Benchmarking Help Center can assist with any other questions, and can be reached at (855)858-6878, or by email: Info@ChicagoEnergyBenchmarking.org.\r\n\r\nThis dataset will be refreshed periodically as additional information becomes available.

Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\n\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates\r\ntogether may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "title": "Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Segments", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/columns.svc", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Transportation"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4yu-snrx", "issued": "2016-01-14", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2016-08-24", "keyword": ["deprecated", "map_layer", "tif", "shapefiles", "kml", "gis", "boundaries"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Jonathan Levy", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4yu-snrx", "description": "OUTDATED.

The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)  The collection of street segments for a single zone (collectively identified by Zone number) are not required to constitute a seamless polygon; however, they must be contiguous; in this sense, \u201cZones\u201d often closer resemble a collection of intersecting segments rather than an unbroken area. Segments are commonly categorized as being either \u201cStandard\u201d or \u201cBuffer\u201d: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as \u2018Buffer\u2019 can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)  Physical signs will display the zone number and the day/times when the zone restriction is in effect, e.g., \u201cAll Times\u201d / \u201cAnytime\u201d; \u201cMonday through Friday\u201d; \u201c6am \u2013 6pm All Days.\u201d  During restricted days/times, any vehicle parked in the zone which does not display a valid unexpired zone product (either a daily permit or an annual pass printed on the City Vehicle Sticker) is subject to ticketing/enforcement.

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \r\n \r\nConfirmed cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way  to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among confirmed cases based on the week of death. \r\n \r\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). Only molecular (PCR) tests reported to CDPH through electronic lab reporting are included. Early in the pandemic, electronic lab reporting took time to onboard and testing availability was severely restricted. As a result, numbers prior to May 1, 2020 will be an undercount of community infection.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \r\n \r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \r\n\r\nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.
