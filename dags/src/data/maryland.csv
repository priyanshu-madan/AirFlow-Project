The cumulative number of probable COVID-19 deaths among Maryland residents, by date of death.

<b>Description</b>
The MD COVID-19 - Total Probable Deaths by Date of Death data layer is a collection of the statewide probable COVID-19 related deaths that have been reported each day by the Vital Statistics Administration by date of death. A death is classified as probable if the person's death certificate notes COVID-19 to be a probable, suspect or presumed cause or condition. Probable deaths are not yet been confirmed by a laboratory test. Some data on deaths may be unavailable due to the time lag between the death, typically reported by a hospital or other facility, and the submission of the complete death certificate. Confirmed deaths are available from the MD COVID-19 - Total Confirmed Deaths by Date of Death data layer.

<b>Description</b>
The MD COVID-19 - Number of Cases by Affected Congregate Facility data layer is a collection of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes of 10 or more and state and local facilities where at least one positive COVID-19 test result has been reported for the reporting period. Data are reported to MDH by local health departments, the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and the Department of Juvenile Services. To appear on the list, facilities report at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 over the prior 14 days. Facilities are removed from the list when health officials determine 14 days have passed with no new cases and no tests pending. The list provides a point-in-time picture of COVID-19 case activity among these facilities. Numbers reported for each facility listed reflect totals ever reported for cases. Data are updated once weekly.

Confirmed COVID-19 deaths among Maryland residents within a single Maryland jurisdiction who live and work in congregate living facilities for the reporting period.

<b>Description</b>
The MD COVID-19 - Total Deaths in Congregate Facility Settings data layer is a total of deaths confirmed by a positive COVID-19 test result that have been reported to MDH in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes of 10 or more and state and local facilities in each Maryland jurisdiction for the reporting period. Data are reported to MDH by local health departments, the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and the Department of Juvenile Services. To appear on the list, facilities report at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 over the prior 14 days. Facilities are removed from the list when health officials determine 14 days have passed with no new cases and no tests pending. The list provides a point-in-time picture of COVID-19 case activity among these facilities. Numbers reported for each facility listed reflect totals ever reported for deaths. Data are updated once weekly.
