This is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/latest-data.html.

For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.

This dataset is a companion to the COVID-19 Daily Cases and Deaths dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/naz8-j4nc). The major difference in this dataset is that the cases, deaths, and corresponding rates per 100,000 population are not those for the single date indicated. They are rolling averages for the seven-day period ending on that date. This rolling average is used to account for fluctuations that may occur in the data, such as fewer cases being reported on weekends, and small numbers.  The intent is to give a more representative view of the ongoing COVID-19 experience, less affected by what is essentially noise in the data.

All rates are per 100,000 population in the indicated group, or Chicago, as a whole, for “Total” columns.

Only Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider.

Confirmed cases are counted on the date the test specimen was collected. Deaths are those occurring among confirmed cases based on the day of death. Demographic data are based on what is reported by medical providers and is not verified by CDPH.

Denominators are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimate for 2018 and can be seen in the Citywide, 2018 row of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa).

All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects cases and deaths currently known to CDPH.

Numbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to definitions of COVID-19-related cases and deaths, sources used, how cases and deaths are associated to a specific date, and similar factors.

All Chicago area (EMS Region XI) hospitals (n=27) are required to report bed and ventilator capacity, availability, and occupancy to the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) daily.

This is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/latest-data.html.

For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.

This dataset contains counts of people tested for COVID-19 and their results. This dataset differs from https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/gkdw-2tgv in that each person is in this dataset only once, even if tested multiple times. In the other dataset, each test is counted, even if multiple tests are performed on the same person, although a person should not appear in that dataset more than once on the same day unless he/she had both a positive and not-positive test.

Only Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider.

Only polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests are included, and only one test is counted for each individual. Tests are counted on the day the specimen was collected. A small number of tests collected prior to 3/1/2020 are not included in the table.

Positive lab results are confirmed for COVID-19. Not-positive lab results include negative results, invalid results, and tests not performed due to improper collection. Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) does not receive all not-positive results.

Demographic data are more complete for those who test positive; care should be taken when calculating percentage positivity among demographic groups.

All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received.

Only Chicago residents are included based on the home ZIP Code as provided by the medical provider. If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as ""Unknown"". 
 
Confirmed cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the “Cases - Weekly” column is not a reliable way  to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among confirmed cases based on the week of death. 
 
For tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). Only molecular (PCR) tests reported to CDPH through electronic lab reporting are included. Early in the pandemic, electronic lab reporting took time to onboard and testing availability was severely restricted. As a result, numbers prior to May 1, 2020 will be an undercount of community infection.

The “Percent Tested Positive” columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. 
 
All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. 

To compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf. Both ZIP Codes and Community Areas are also geographic datasets on this data portal.

Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). Only molecular (PCR) tests reported to CDPH through electronic lab reporting are included. Early in the pandemic, electronic lab reporting took time to onboard and testing availability was severely restricted. As a result, numbers prior to May 1, 2020 will be an undercount of community infection.

The “Percent Tested Positive” columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. 
 
All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. 

To compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf. Both ZIP Codes and Community Areas are also geographic datasets on this data portal.

Only Chicago residents are included based on the home ZIP Code as provided by the medical provider. If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as ""Unknown"". 
 
Confirmed cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the “Cases - Weekly” column is not a reliable way  to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among confirmed cases based on the week of death. 
 
For tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included.
