California has a new blueprint for reducing COVID-19 in the state with revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities. Every county in California is assigned to a tier based on its test positivity and adjusted case rate for tier assignment. Additionally, a new health equity metric took effect on October 6, 2020. In order to advance to the next less restrictive tier, each county will need to meet an equity metric or demonstrate targeted investments to eliminate disparities in levels of COVID-19 transmission, depending on its size. The California Health Equity Metric is designed to help guide counties in their continuing efforts to reduce COVID-19 cases in all communities and requires more intensive efforts to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among Californians who have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic.

California has a new blueprint for reducing COVID-19 in the state with revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities. Every county in California is assigned to a tier based on its test positivity and adjusted case rate for tier assignment. Additionally, a new health equity metric took effect on October 6, 2020. In order to advance to the next less restrictive tier, each county will need to meet an equity metric or demonstrate targeted investments to eliminate disparities in levels of COVID-19 transmission, depending on its size. The California Health Equity Metric is designed to help guide counties in their continuing efforts to reduce COVID-19 cases in all communities and requires more intensive efforts to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among Californians who have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic.

The counties with or without health orders requiring HCP who decline vaccination to wear surgical masks during influenza season are indicated as mask required yes/no. The HCP influenza vaccination rates are presented for each county. Based on the national Healthy People 2020 goal of 90% HCP influenza vaccination, hospitals that achieved the Healthy People 2010 goal of 60% vaccination need to increase their annual vaccination percentage by at least 3% per year to reach 90% by 2020. In 2017-18, hospitals should have achieved at least 84% vaccination coverage to demonstrate sufficient incremental progress to reach 90% by 2020. It is indicated (yes/no) whether a county is on track to achieve the 90% goal by 2020.
Note: The Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRF) are excluded, for detailed explanation see Technical Notes. Two counties are excluded from this report. Alpine County has a mask policy but no acute care hospital, therefore, is not subject to these reporting requirements. Sierra County has no mask policy and no acute care hospital.

Hospitals must report HCP influenza vaccination data to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), including the percentage of HCP vaccinated. CDPH is required to make this information public on an annual basis [Health and Safety Code section 1288.8 (b)].

California acute care hospitals are required to offer free influenza vaccine to HCP. Hospital HCP must receive an annual vaccine or sign a declination form. Hospitals collect vaccination data for all HCP physically working in the hospital for at least one day during influenza season, regardless of clinical responsibility or patient contact. Hospitals report HCP vaccination rates to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and CDPH publishes the hospital results annually. CDPH reports data separately for hospital employees, licensed independent practitioners such as physicians, other contract staff, and trainees and volunteers (Health and Safety Code section 1288.7-1288.8).

Detailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest.
