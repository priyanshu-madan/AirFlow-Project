The Maryland Artificial Reef Initiative (MARI) is a state-run initiative -  managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources -  aimed at developing new fish habitats in the Chesapeake Bay by way of depositing artificial materials (such as concrete reef balls or recycled porcelain) to the bottom of designated sections of water in the Chesapeake Bay. The goal is to see an oyster population develop on the artificial materials -  which can attract fish and other marine creatures to the site.

In 1993 -  the Maryland Department of Planning and the Maryland State Highway Administration entered into a Data Base Usage Agreement with Bell Atlantic and Data Chromatics -  Inc. to develop an enhanced street address map for Maryland. ZIP Code boundary area files were one of the products derived from this partnership. The resulting boundary area files were intended to improve the cartographic quality and accuracy of the ZIP code boundary area files derived from the U.S. Census Bureau's post 1990 Census TIGER\\Line Files (based on the Census Bureau's ZIP code tabulation areas -  ZCTAs). Subsequent iterative improvements to the ZIP Code boundary area files have been made using premise address information associated with mapped parcel records as provided in the Maryland Department of Planning's MdProperty View GIS tax map and parcel record DVD product. The resulting files are meant to serve as a good approximation\"\" of ZIP codes as polygons (which in reality they are not) but are not official ZIP Code maps and are not meant to be a substitute for any products offered by the U.S. Postal Service -  the official source for ZIP code information. While there are no restrictions on their use we do recommend that they are best used with MdProperty View and that MDP makes no guarantee or warranty regarding the files.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

(EDI) of Gaithersburg -  Md. -  to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation -  which was based on photo interpretation of 3.75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). In areas where a wetlands coverage was not yet available -  EDI interpreted shorelines directly from the orthophotography. DOQQ registration (Maryland State Plane Coordinate System -  NAD 83 -  meters) was transferred automatically to the shoreline vectors. Following shoreline extraction or interpretation -  EDI assigned attributes to the vectors based on shoreline type: beach -  vegetated -  structure -  or water's edge.

An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD) -  which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard -  necessarily -  to population. Places always nest within a State -  but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city -  town -  village -  or borough -  but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name -  but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State -  local -  and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1 -  2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Demographics/MD_CensusDesignatedAreas/FeatureServer/1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS: The Spatial Data and the information therein (collectively \"the Data\") is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind either expressed implied or statutory.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

To quantify rates of change (erosion or accretion) along coastal and estuarine shorelines in Maryland -  the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) -  in conjunction with Towson University's Center for Geographic Information Sciences (CGIS) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) -  installed and ran a computer program -  the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) -  using as input a series of digital shoreline vectors dating from 1841-1995. Shorelines were derived from three sources: (1) maps from a Historical Shorelines and Erosion Rates Atlas (Conkwright -  1975) -  (2) Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS) -  a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -  and (3) a digital wetlands delineation based on photo interpretation of digital orthophoto quarter quads. DSAS constructed a 'baseline' landward of and approximately parallel to the shorelines -  inserted nodes every 20 m along the baseline -  and cast straight-line transects from each node -  perpendicular to the baseline -  across the shorelines. Based on the time elapsed and the along-transect distance between shoreline pairs -  DSAS calculated rates of change for each transect.

The Maryland Inventory should not be confused with the National Register of Historic Places -  the Maryland Register of Historic Properties -  or local lists of locally designated historic resources -  although resources listed in all of the above categories are included in the Maryland Inventory.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov. In 2007 -  State leaders in Maryland took a bold step in their efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay with the creation of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Trust Fund (Trust Fund). The Trust Fund allows Maryland to accelerate Bay restoration by focusing limited financial resources on the most effective non-point source pollution control projects. Dollars for the Trust Fund are generated through motor fuel tax and rental car tax in Maryland. It is anticipated that when fully-funded -  the Trust Fund will generate $50M annually. This file depicts the Bay Trust Fund current priority zones. Priority zone areas were developed using information from the USGS SPARROW model and local knowledge and expertise. Coastal Bays watersheds were prioritized based on the expertise of scientists in that region. - SPARROW is a regression-based model for regional interpretation of water quality monitoring data. SPARROW discriminates which watersheds are likely to contribute the highest nutrient and sediment loads to the Chesapeake Bay. - The Biological Restoration Initiative (BRI) targeting identifies biologically impaired waters that demonstrate a high potential for removal from Marylands 303(d) list of impaired waters. Their selection is based on evaluation using the Biological Listing Methodology results listed in Marylands 2008 Integrated Report -  which sets a threshold for degradation within Marylands non-tidal freshwater streams using the index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores from sampled fish and benthic communities. These watersheds have been targeted primarily for 319(h) grant program -  which has a goal of delisting impaired surface waters. - The Atlantic Coastal Bay watersheds were selected based on the pattern of trajectories of the water quality index (dissolved oxygen -  chlorophyll a -  total nitrogen -  total phosphorus) between 2001-2006 (http://ian.umces.edu/press/books/publication/93/shifting_sands_envi ronmental_and_cultural_change_in_maryland_s_coastal_bays_2009- 06-08/). Agricultural and urbanized watersheds were evaluated separately to identify the highest nutrient loading areas. For urban watersheds developed lands were analyzed -  while agricultural watersheds were separated into cropland and animal production systems.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Each point in Coastal Resiliency Assessment Shoreline Points represents a 250 meter segment of the Maryland coast -  including Atlantic -  Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay shorelines. The Natural Capital Project's Coastal Vulnerability model was used to calculate a Shoreline Hazard Index -  representing the relative exposure of each segment to storm-induced erosion and flooding. Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology -  elevation -  sea level rise -  wave power -  storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest -  marsh -  dune -  oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR's Community Flood Risk Areas (March -  2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities.This dataset was produced under award number NA13NOS4190136 from the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) -  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Chesapeake and Coastal Services (CCS).

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

As a member of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO) -  Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program is collecting information on how the public uses the Atlantic coast of Maryland. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  shipping -  military exercises -  sand mining -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. In 2000 -  the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) was awarded a Coastal Zone Management grant to complete the acquisition of a recent (ca. 1990) digital shoreline for the coastal regions of Maryland -- the Chesapeake Bay -  its tributaries -  the coastal bays -  and the Atlantic coast. MGS contracted the services of EarthData International -  Inc. (EDI) -  currently of Frederick -  Md. -  to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation -  which was based on photo interpretation of 3.75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). In areas where a wetlands coverage was not yet available -  EDI interpreted shorelines directly from the orthophotography. DOQQ registration (Maryland State Plane Coordinate System -  NAD 83 -  meters) was transferred automatically to the shoreline vectors. Following shoreline extraction or interpretation -  EDI assigned attributes to the vectors based on shoreline type: beach -  vegetated -  structure -  or water's edge. All four categories are linear features -  except 'beach - ' which -  if sufficiently wide -  can be both linear and polygonal. Shorelines were merged into 7.5-minute quadrangles -  provided that the aerial photography on which the DOQQs were based was flown in the same year. MGS used the shorelines to create a series of Shoreline Changes maps. In doing so -  MGS erased the landward edge of beach polygons -  leaving the seaward edge intact as a linear feature. The Geographic Information Services Division of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) merged the shorelines for all of the 7.5-minute quadrangles into a single -  statewide coverage. MGS -  working collaboratively with Towson University's Center for Geographic Sciences (CGIS) -  subsequently used the recent shorelines -  along with historical ones -  as input into a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) program -  the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) (Danforth and Thieler -  1992; Thieler and others -  2001). DSAS determines linear rates of shoreline change (erosion or accretion) along closely spaced -  shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output -  the collaborators assigned the following erosion rate categories as attributes to the recent shoreline -  clipped by county from the statewide coverage: a) High erosion rate (more than 8 ft/yr) -  b) Moderate erosion rate (4-8 ft/yr) -  c) Low erosion rate (2-4 ft/yr) -  d) Slight erosion rate (0-2 ft/yr) -  e) No change -  f) Accretion -  g) Protected -  h) Unknown and i) No Data The DOQQs from which the shorelines were interpreted meet National Map Accuracy Standards at the production scale of 1:12 - 000 using the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing(ASPRS) method. Consider the scale in displaying and using the vectors.  Displaying the vectors at scales larger than those of the source documents is considered bad practice. See Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report for positional inaccuracies in the data set. The aerial photography from which the DOQQs were developed was not tide-coordinated. Therefore -  shoreline in this data set do not reprsent a consistent vertical datum.

The service depicts the number of broadband service providers per census block and the layer represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) area of broadband availability. The number of broadband providers per census block is illustrated. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks -  less than 2 square miles -  where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For this purpose -  'broadband service' is the provision -  on either a commercial or non-commercial basis -  of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users -  or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose -  an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party -  institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs) -  special access lines -  or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose -  'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does -  or could -  within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources -  provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

The areas in this data set were determined from USGS Terrapin studies (for more information contact Paula Henry -  410-465-0550 or paula.henry@usgs.gov) -  DNR studies conducted by Margaret Whilden -  and a terrapin study conducted by Willem Roosenburg (contact information can be acquired from Harley Speir of DNR Fisheries Service). For extent acquracies please contact the project lead for each study. Secondary habitats were delineated using sandy beach data from VIMS and salinity data from Lee Karrh of DNR. Sandy beach areas were selected and exported from the source file and then combined with the salinity data to determine sensitivity importance levels. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Biota/MD_LivingResources/FeatureServer/1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS: The Spatial Data and the information therein (collectively \"the Data\") is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind either expressed implied or statutory.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. These data map hub and corridor elements within the green infrastructure. The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Methods used to identify and rank green infrastructure lands are intended soley for this use. Other applications are at the discretion of the user. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data and does not necessarily endorse any uses or products derived from the data other than those for which the data were originally intended. Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services -  such as cleaning the air -  filtering water -  storing and cycling nutrients -  conserving soils -  regulating climate -  and maintaining hydrologic function -  are all provided by the existing expanses of forests -  wetlands -  and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services -  like forest products -  fish and wildlife -  and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure -  we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology -  and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife -  for example) -  how a given place fits into a larger system -  the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas -  the importance of coordinating local -  state and even interstate planning -  and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - hubs\"\" and \"\"corridors.\"\" Hubs typically large contiguous areas -  separated by major roads and/or human land uses -  that contain one or more of the following: Large blocks of contiguous interior forest (containing at least 250 acres -  plus a transition zone of 300 feet) Large wetland complexes -  with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; Important animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres -  including rare -  threatened -  and endangered species locations -  unique ecological communities -  and migratory bird habitats; relatively pristine stream and river segments (which -  when considered with adjacent forests and wetlands -  are at least 100 acres) that support trout -  mussels -  and other sensitive aquatic organisms; and existing protected natural resource lands which contain one or more of the above (for example -  state parks and forests -  National Wildlife Refuges -  locally owned reservoir properties -  major stream valley parks -  and Nature Conservancy preserves). In the GIA model -  the above features were identified from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial data that covered the entire state. Developed areas and major roads were excluded -  areas less than 100 contiguous acres were dropped -  adjacent forest and wetland were added to the remaining hubs -  and the edges were smoothed. The average size of all hubs in the state is approximately 2200 acres. Corridors are linear features connecting hubs together to help animals and plant propagules to move between hubs. Corridors were identified using many sets of data -  including land cover -  roads -  streams -  slope -  flood plains -  aquatic resource data -  and fish blockages. Generally speaking -  corridors connect hubs of similar type (hubs containing forests are connected to one ano", "title": "MD iMAP: Maryland Green Infrastructure - Green Infrastructure Hubs And Corridors", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/7a66e97515cf481499a392d296e315c9_0", "mediaType": "text/html"}], "theme": ["Biota"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://opendata.maryland.gov/d/843n-d2np", "issued": "2014-02-20", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2017-09-06", "keyword": ["lpg", "liquefied petroleum gas", "cng", "compressed natural gas", "ethanol", "e-85", "biodiesel", "clean energy", "energy", "transportation", "electric vehicle", "ev"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Jenn", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@opendata.maryland.gov"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "opendata.maryland.gov"}, "identifier": "https://opendata.maryland.gov/api/views/843n-d2np", "description": "It takes a lot of fuel to move Marylanders from point \u201cA\u201d to point \u201cB.\u201d The Maryland Energy Administration (MEA) offers incentives to reduce the amount of energy residents expend on travel.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Physiography is the study and classification of the natural landscape of the earth and the landforms that comprise it.

Subdivisions are based on similarities (within) and differences (among) geologic structure -  rock type -  geomorphic history -  and topographic characteristics. Data and subdivisions were compiled at a 1:100 - 000 scale for the detailed state-wide map. The hierarchical classification of the detailed physiographic map (in progress) includes subdivisions as follows -  in descending order (and generally decreasing size): Province -  Section -  Region -  District -  Area. In Maryland there are portions of five physiographic Provinces. In this file -  the polygons reflect Province level subdivision. The polygon feature attribute table has been developed to pertain only to the Provinces level.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features -  such as streets -  roads -  streams -  and railroad tracks -  and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city -  town -  township -  and county limits -  and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example -  a block in a city bounded by streets. However -  census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas -  rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints -  along with roads and water features -  to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result -  all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area -  so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.

As a member of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO) -  Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program is collecting information on how the public uses the Atlantic coast of Maryland. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  shipping -  military exercises -  sand mining -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov. The Marsh Protection Potential Index (MPPI) ranks Maryland's coastal marshes by their ability to protect vulnerable communities from coastal hazards. To do so -  we identified five key questions to assess each marsh: How much is the marsh able to reduce the impact of coastal hazards?Is the marsh located where coastal hazards are a threat?Is the marsh located where there are people to protect? Is the marsh located adjacent to other protective habitats?Is the marsh likely to survive in the face of rising sea levels?Using data from the Coastal Resiliency Assessment and other sources -  we developed metrics to score each marsh on these five questions. Then -  the sub-scores were combined to create the Marsh Protection Potential Index overall rating -  which ranks the protective ability of over 14 - 000 marshes statewide.It is important to note that the MPPI ranks marshes relative to other marshes -  rather than providing an absolute measure of protective services. The Marsh Protection Potential Index does not attempt to describe the dollar-value of protective services provided by each marsh -  nor does it compare marshes to other types of habitat or to other protection infrastructure solutions. In addition -  the MPPI does not assess marshes on any of the other characteristics that often inform conservation priorities. Things like biodiversity -  ecosystem health -  rare species -  recreation value -  or water quality services are often important to stakeholders -  and these are not captured by the MPPI. The MPPI is intended to supplement -  not replace -  the other ways conservation decision-makers prioritize natural habitats.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

This application is based on their Marine Mammal and Seabird Computer Database Analysis System (MMS-CDAS). The origin of the underlying data is a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service aerial survey conducted between December -  2001 and March -  2003. The source data were collected on-transect (120m width -  60 m each side) for transects conducted in the mouth of Chesapeake Bay -  in Delaware Bay -  and in offshore waters from the beach outward. Aerial surveys of waterbirds were flown to at least 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore from northern New Jersey to the Virginia / North Carolina border. All waterbird species in the USFWS database from winter surveys only were exported to density blocks. Information in the MMS application suggests the winter surveys only are valid for calculating densities because they were flown on specific transects. The spatial extent of the database (and thus of this data set) is from the Virginia/North Carolina border to the Hudson Canyon (including Delaware Bay and the lowest part of Chesapeake Bay).

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

The Program coordinates the acquisition of lands for the use of all units of DNR. Stateside POS funds are allocated to purchase land for state parks -  forests -  wildlife habitat -  natural -  scenic and cultural resources for public use. A portion of stateside funds are also dedicated to capital improvements -  critical maintenance -  and operations in state parks. Stateside POS projects are now being driven by a new Targeting System -  which uses the best scientific information available to target the program's limited funds. In the case of a project with multiple parcels -  the Identify results will indicate the total acreage and BPW amount for the project. Hence -  you will see the same acreage -  BPW amount and TEA result for each part of the project. This file consists of stateside POS projects only.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters.

In 2007 -  State leaders in Maryland took a bold step in their efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay with the creation of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Trust Fund (Trust Fund). The Trust Fund allows Maryland to accelerate Bay restoration by focusing limited financial resources on the most effective non-point source pollution control projects. Dollars for the Trust Fund are generated through motor fuel tax and rental car tax in Maryland. It is anticipated that when fully-funded -  the Trust Fund will generate $50M annually.

A key driver of increased transit ridership in Maryland, TOD capitalizes on existing rapid transit infrastructure. The online tool focuses on the MTA\u2019s existing MARC Commuter Rail, Metro Subway, and Central Light Rail lines and includes information specific to each station. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this dataset is to give MTA planning staff, developers, local governments, and transit riders a picture of how each MTA rail station could attract TOD investment. In order to make this assessment, MTA staff gathered data on characteristics that are likely to influence TOD potential. The station-specific data is organized into 6 different categories referring to transit activity; station facilities; parking provision and utilization; bicycle and pedestrian access; and local zoning and land availability around each station. \r\n\r\nAs a publicly shared resource, this dataset can be used by local communities to identify and prioritize area improvements in coordination with the MTA that can help attract investment around rail stations.\r\n\r\nYou can view an interactive version of this dataset at geodata.md.gov/tod.\r\n\r\n ** Ridership is calculated the following ways:\r\nMetro Rail ridership is based on Metro gate exit counts.\r\nLight Rail ridership is estimated using a statistical sampling process in line with FTA established guidelines, and approved by the FTA.\r\nMARC ridership is calculated using two (2) independent methods:\r\nMonthly Line level ridership is estimated using a statistical sampling process in line with FTA established guidelines, and approved by the FTA. This method of ridership calculation is used by the MTA for official reporting purposes to State level and Federal level reporting.\r\nStation level ridership is estimated by using person counts completed by the third party vendor. This method of calculation has not been verified by the FTA for statistical reporting and is used for scheduling purposes only. However, because of the granularity of detail, this information is useful for TOD applications.\r\n*Please note that the monthly level ridership and the station level ridership are calculated using two (2) independent methods that are not interchangeable and should not be compared for analysis purposes.", "title": "MTA Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Data", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://opendata.maryland.gov/api/views/cqt2-ypem/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://opendata.maryland.gov/api/views/cqt2-ypem/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://opendata.maryland.gov/api/views/cqt2-ypem/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://opendata.maryland.gov/api/views/cqt2-ypem/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://opendata.maryland.gov/api/views/cqt2-ypem/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://opendata.maryland.gov/api/views/cqt2-ypem/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://opendata.maryland.gov/api/views/cqt2-ypem/columns.svc", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Transportation"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://opendata.maryland.gov/d/crhh-dpu5", "issued": "2016-07-28", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2020-01-25", "keyword": ["wfs", "wms", "maryland department of natural resources", "dnr", "dynamic", "vector", "md imap", "md", "scenic or natural views", "recreational nonmotorized vessel wildlife viewing", "bay use", "bays", "maryland", "recreational waterfowl hunting", "guided wildlife viewing", "cultural use", "recreational shellfish harvesting", "swimming", "eastern shores", "recreational fishing from motorized vessels", "recreational nonmotorized vessel fishing", "choptank river", "guided diving and snorkeling", "guided scenic viewing", "scubasnorkelingdiving", "recreational use", "recreational kayak fishing", "recreational shore fishing", "guided fishing", "bay uses", "socioeconomics", "sailing", "guided party cruises", "charter transport", "shore use", "fishing", "historic or cultural use", "environment", "geoscientificinformation", "surface water sports", "chesapeake bay", "motorized boating", "society", "nonconsumptive use", "paddling"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Open Data Administrator", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@opendata.maryland.gov"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "opendata.maryland.gov"}, "identifier": "https://opendata.maryland.gov/api/views/crhh-dpu5", "description": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer.

Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized.

The data is essential in the planning -  design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of state highway improvement and safety programs. TMS is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991 -  which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet SHA's long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent -  continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts.The Maryland Traffic Volume Maps depict the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) at various locations on Maryland's roadways by county. Traffic Volume data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs -  located throughout Maryland. To date -  four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday -  respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority.

The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Methods used to identify and rank green infrastructure lands are intended soley for this use. Other applications are at the discretion of the user. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data and does not necessarily endorse any uses or products derived from the data other than those for which the data were originally intended. Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services -  such as cleaning the air -  filtering water -  storing and cycling nutrients -  conserving soils -  regulating climate -  and maintaining hydrologic function -  are all provided by the existing expanses of forests -  wetlands -  and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services -  like forest products -  fish and wildlife -  and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure -  we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology -  and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife -  for example) -  how a given place fits into a larger system -  the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas -  the importance of coordinating local -  state and even interstate planning -  and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - hubs\"\" and \"\"corridors.\"\" Gaps are developed -  agricultural -  mined -  or cleared lands within the Green infrastructure network that could be targeted for restoration. These were evaluated for their potential restoration to forest -  wetland -  or riparian buffers -  by considering watershed condition -  landscape position -  local features -  ownership -  and programmatic considerations. Gaps with hydric soils were probably once wetlands -  and could be restored as such. Reforestation of gaps along streams would not only benefit wildlife -  but improve water quality and stream stability.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

As a member of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO) -  Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program is collecting information on how the public uses the Atlantic coast of Maryland. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  shipping -  military exercises -  sand mining -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

The second year of the regional project expanded the year 1 pilot inventory focusing next on the lower eastern shore of Maryland including the Atlantic Coastal Bays -  south of the Choptank watershed pilot study area to the Virginia border.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for Hydrologic unit boundaries define the aerial extent of surface water drainage to a point. Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for the United States. This system divides the country into 21 Regions -  222 Subregions -  352 Accounting Units -  and 2 - 149 Cataloging Units based on surface hydrologic features. The smallest USGS unit (8-digit HU) is approximately 448 - 000 acres. During the late 1970's the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) -  formerly the Soil Conservation Service -  initiated a national program to further subdivide HU's into smaller watersheds for water resources planning. A 3-digit extension was added to the 8-digit identification. By the early 1980's this 11-digit HU mapping was completed for most of the U.S. These data demonstrate Maryland's watersheds as represented by the federal Hydrologic Unit Code denoted by an 11-digit numerical code. The watersheds were defined using contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets. The state has been divided into 138 watersheds that are identified by Maryland -  using an 8-digit numerical code. These watersheds are equivalent to the HUC 11-digit codes. The watershed file is generally considered to be map accurate at a scale of 1:24 - 000. A new 12-digit watershed file is available from DNR which provides more detailed line work for over 1 - 100 watersheds which is approximately equivalent to the HUC 14-digit code.

As a member of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO) -  Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program is collecting information on how the public uses the Atlantic coast of Maryland. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  shipping -  military exercises -  sand mining -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

The Integrated Report (IR) combines two water quality reports required under sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act.  Section 305(b) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to perform annual water quality assessments to determine the status of jurisdictional waters.  Section 303(d) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to identify waters assessed as not meeting water quality standards(see Code of Maryland Regulations 26.08.02).  Waters that do not meet standards may require a Total Maximum Daily Load to determine the maximum amount of an impairing substance or pollutant that a particular water body can assimilate and still meet water quality criteria.

As part of this initiative -  a critical element is the identification of Wind Energy Areas (WEA) on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) off the Atlantic coast. WEAs are offshore locations that appear most suitable for wind energy development. Secretary Salazar identified the WEAs on February 7 -  2011 in a joint announcement with Secretary Chu of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the National Strategic Work Plan for Offshore Wind. Data has been and will continue to be collected for these high priority areas to inform government and industry assessments and planning -  allowing a more efficient process for permitting and siting responsible development.

The annual inspection process includes the development of a Structural Inventory and Appraisal (SI&A) assessment that is submitted to the Federal Highway Administration each April for the preceding calendar year.The data for this measure is collected from the SI&A assessment that is performed yearly by the MDTA's facilities inspection consultant. \r\n\r\n The MDTA continued to be successful in having 100 percent of its bridges fully operational and functioning (no weight restrictions), allowing all emergency vehicles, school buses, vehicles serving the economy of an area, and legally loaded vehicles to safely traverse. Bridges are considered structurally deficient if significant load carrying elements are found to be in a poor (or worse) condition due to deterioration and/or damage, or have a low weight restriction.  The fact that a bridge is structurally deficient does not imply that it is unsafe.\r\n\r\nData submitted for the CY are provided in February, but the data is not provided to FHWA until April.

Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov. Each point in Coastal Resiliency Assessment Shoreline Points represents a 250 meter segment of the Maryland coast -  including Atlantic -  Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay shorelines. The Natural Capital Project's Coastal Vulnerability model was used to calculate a Shoreline Hazard Index -  representing the relative exposure of each segment to storm-induced erosion and flooding. Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology -  elevation -  sea level rise -  wave power -  storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest -  marsh -  dune -  oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR's Community Flood Risk Areas (March -  2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities.This dataset was produced under award number NA13NOS4190136 from the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) -  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Chesapeake and Coastal Services (CCS). The statements -  finding and recommendations are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or the U.S. Department of Commerce.

These data map hub and corridor elements within the green infrastructure. The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - \"hubs\" and \"corridors.\" \n\nHubs typically large contiguous areas, separated by major roads and/or human land uses, that contain one or more of the following: Large blocks of contiguous interior forest (containing at least 250 acres, plus a transition zone of 300 feet) Large wetland complexes, with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; Important animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres, including rare, threatened, and endangered species locations, unique ecological communities, and migratory bird habitats; relatively pristine stream and river segments (which, when considered with adjacent forests and wetlands, are at least 100 acres) that support trout, mussels, and other sensitive aquatic organisms; and existing protected natural resource lands which contain one or more of the above (for example, state parks and forests, National Wildlife Refuges, locally owned reservoir properties, major stream valley parks, and Nature Conservancy preserves). In the GIA model, the above features were identified from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial data that covered the entire state. Developed areas and major roads were excluded, areas less than 100 contiguous acres were dropped, adjacent forest and wetland were added to the remaining hubs, and the edges were smoothed. The average size of all hubs in the state is approximately 2200 acres.\n\n\nCorridors are linear features connecting hubs together to help animals and plant propagules to move between hubs. Corridors were identified using many sets of data, including land cover, roads, streams, slope, flood plains, aquatic resource data, and fish blockages. Generally speaking, corridors connect hubs of similar type (hubs containing forests are connected to one another; while those consisting primarily of wetlands are connected to others containing wetlands).

A shoreline file developed by the Maryland State Highway Administration was buffered 100-feet to determine the shoreline buffer in Maryland. The resulting buffer layers were clipped with a forest cover layer to determine the presence and absence of forest in those buffers. The forest cover layer was derived from a tree canopy layer developed by the Community College of Baltimore County -  Catonsville -  Geography Department. The tree canopy was developed using 2007 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) color infra-red 1-meter imagery. To determine areas forested -  contiguous areas of tree cover less than 1 acre were removed from the dataset and then used for clipping the stream and shoreline buffers.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Biota/MD_Forests/FeatureServer/1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS: The Spatial Data and the information therein (collectively \"the Data\") is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind either expressed implied or statutory.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

A portion of stateside funds are also dedicated to capital improvements -  critical maintenance -  and operations in state parks.

In cases where there is no remaining AC in a nested catchment but the larger encompassing segment has remaining AC -  the smaller nested catchment is split out and assigned its own identification. These nested catchments are also then attributed to show the lack of AC remaining. The intended use of the catchment dataset is to assist State -  Local -  and Federal officials and stakeholders in determining the antidegradation status of current or planned activities which fall under the purview of the antidegradation policy and implementation procedure (COMAR 26.08.02.04-1).  Using GIS -  the stakeholder can assess if any activity -  proposed or operational -  such as a discharge -  is located on land which drains (has run off) directly into and can potentially adversely affect a Tier II stream segment.  This type of determination would be useful for permitting purposes -  screening for sensitive or high quality resources -  and various land use planning activities such as those undertaken by local officials during the Water Resources Element process -  Water and Sewer Planning -  or the Comprehensive Planning process.

The Forest Legacy Program is designed to identify and protect environmentally important forest lands that are threatened by present or future conversion to non-forest use through the use of perpetual conservation easements between willing sellers and willing buyers. Only private forest land in a Forest Legacy Area is eligible for the program. Marylands Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) has helped thousands of Maryland landowners plant streamside buffers -  establish wetlands -  protect highly erodible land -  and create wildlife habitat. The State of Maryland has entered into a memorandum of Agreement with USDA authorizing the State of Maryland to continue the voluntary program for the purchase of perpetual easements for Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land. A perpetual CREP easement is a written legal agreement between a landowner and the State of Maryland in which there is an acquired permanent interest in the land to install or maintain conservation practices that protect water quality and natural resources. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) administers the CREP easement program. DNR is also assisted by a number of local governments and non-government organization sponsors.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

The Clean Water Act requires that States review their water quality standards every three years and revise the standards as necessary.  During this required Triennial Review the State reviewed the antidegradation policy -  and identified additional stream segments that meet the minimum requirements. Current Tier II designations are made based on biological characteristics from Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data -  which is collected annually. MBSS data which identifies new Tier II segments in between Triennial Review cycles are maintained on the pending list -  as they are awaiting formal promulgation. The publicly maintained list of all Tier II waters can be found for each county at the following website:  http://mde.maryland.gov/programs/Water/TMDL/Integrated303dReports/Pages/Antidegradation.aspx.

Thirty-five older -  less accurate -  overlapping surveys were entirely omitted before tinning. Partial overlap from other older -  less accurate surveys was also omitted prior to tinning. The surveys used dated from 1859 to 1993. Thirty-six surveys dated from 1859 to 1918 -  thirty-seven from the 1930s -  ninety-one from the 1940s -  sixty- six from the 1950s -  twenty-five from the 1960s -  twenty-four from the 1970s -  fourteen from the 1980s -  and four from the 1990s. The total range of sounding data was 3.7 meters to -50.4 meters at mean low water. Mean high water values between 0.2 and 1.2 meters were assigned to the shoreline. Fifteen points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding data and were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676). Chesapeake Bay has two hundred eighteen 7.5 minute DEMs and ten one degree DEMs. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7.5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record) -  followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1 centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C- record). The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries of the contiguous United States but is not complete.This layer was modified from its original form. Please see lineage section for details.Not to be used for Navigation. Acknowledgment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration- Nation Ocean Service would be appreciated in products derived from these data. The datum for these bathymetric DEMs is not the same as that used by the US Geological survey (USGS) for land based DEMs which results in a discontinuity if the two datasets are merged together. Moreover -  the shoreline for the USGS DEMs is indeterminate and not the same as that used for the Bathymetric DEMs. The data within the bathymetry file is floating point. When using the data within a GIS care must be taken to ensure that the data are being read as floating point and not integer data.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

The digital segmented network based on watershed boundaries -  ERF1-2 -  includes enhancements to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's River Reach File 1 (RF1) (USEPA -  1996; DeWald and others -  1985) to support national and regional-scale surface water-quality modeling. Alexander and others (1999) developed ERF1 -  which assessed the hydrologic integrity of the digital reach traces and calculated the mean water time-of-travel in river reaches and reservoirs. ERF1-2 serves as the foundation for SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions (of nutrient transport) On Watershed) modeling. Within the context of a Geographic Information System -  SPARROW estimates the proportion of watersheds in the conterminous U.S. with outflow concentrations of several nutrients -  including total nitrogen and total phosphorus -  (Smith -  R.A. -  Schwarz -  G.E. -  and Alexander -  R.B. -  1997). This version of the network expands on ERF1 (version 1.2; Alexander et al. 1999) -  and includes the incremental and total drainage area derived from 1-kilometer (km) elevation data for North America. Previous estimates of the water time-of-travel were recomputed for reaches with water- quality monitoring sites that included two reaches. The mean flow and velocity estimates for these split reaches are based on previous estimation methods (Alexander et al. -  1999) and are unchanged in ERF1-2. Drainage area calculations provide data used to estimate the contribution of a given nutrient to the outflow. Data estimates depend on the accuracy of node connectivity. Reaches split at water- quality or pesticide-monitoring sites indicate the source point for estimating the contribution and transport of nutrients and their loads throughout the watersheds. The ERF1-2 coverage extends the earlier ERF1 coverage by providing digital-elevation-model (DEM-based estimates of reach drainage area founded on the 1-kilometer data for North America (Verdin -  1996; Verdin and Jenson -  1996). A 1-kilometer raster grid of ERF1-2 projected to Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area -  NAD 27 Datum (Snyder -  1987) -  was merged with the HYDRO1K flow direction data set (Verdin and Jenson -  1996) to generate a DEM-based watershed grid -  ERF1_2WS. The watershed boundaries are maintained in a raster (grid cell) format as well as a vector (polygon) format for subsequent model analysis. Both the coverage -  ERF1-2 -  and the grid -  ERF1-2WS are available at: http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/gisgetlist. The version of RF1 used to compile ERF1-2 was an early edition of a USGS RF1 translation and was updated by USEPA (USEPA -  1996). The capabilities of the enhanced version of RF1 (ERF1-2) and the current USEPA version have not been evaluated. The user is referred to the USEPA version [http://www.epa.gov/owow/monitoring/rf/rfindex] for discussions of streamflow accuracy and general background on the origin of RF1.

In 1987 -  the Chesapeake Bay Agreement was signed by states within the Chesapeake Bay region including Maryland -  Pennsylvania -  Virginia and the District of Columbia. This agreement included commitments for providing fish passage within each state: to provide for fish passage at dams -  and remove stream blockages wherever necessary to restore passage for migratory fish.\"\" With this humble beginning -  the Chesapeake Bay states set a goal to reopen a total of 1 - 357 miles of historical spawning grounds by the year 2003. Maryland's portion of this goal is to reopen 388.65 miles of stream. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources Fish Passage Program has taken this commitment very seriously; to date the Program has completed 61 projects -  reopening a total 348.9 miles of upstream spawning habitat. Several projects scheduled to be completed by 2003 will allow the Program to not only meet but also exceed the goal set forth by the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Meeting this goal has been a cooperative effort between the Maryland Department of Natural Resources -  State Highway Administration -  National Marine Fisheries Service - National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration -  Department of Interior - US Fish & Wildlife -  Environmental Protection Agency -  Chesapeake Bay Program -  Chesapeake Bay Foundation -  University Maryland and a multitude of others including private citizens -  local watershed groups and local governments.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Biota/MD_LivingResources/FeatureServer/0 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS: The Spatial Data and the information therein (collectively the \"\"Data\"\") is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind either expressed implied or statutory.

Some watersheds drainage areas were defined for streams less than third order and some large area watershed were split to maintain a maximum size of 15 - 000 acres. The watershed boundaries in this file were developed in a joint state and federal effort to create a consistent watershed file for use by all government agencies with an interest in Maryland's watersheds. The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) redefined the third order watersheds creating the HUA14 file.

The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1 - 200 and 8 - 000 people -  with an optimum size of 4 - 000 people. When first delineated -  census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics -  economic status -  and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances -  a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.

The interim Sustainable Communities designation will continue for a transition period and local governments will have the opportunity to apply for continued designation. The term of the transition period is as follows: Existing Designated Neighborhoods will automatically become Sustainable Communities effective June 1 -  2010. The designation will continue for a period of 24 months -  during which time local governments will have the opportunity to apply for continued Sustainable Communities designation. Community Legacy Areas designated prior to January 1 -  2008 will become Sustainable Community for 24 months after June 1 -  2010. Existing Community Legacy Areas designated on or after January 1 -  2008 will be considered Sustainable Communities for a period of 36 months after June 1 -  2010. An application procedure is being developed for local governments to request continued Sustainable Communities designation beyond the transition period. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) will begin accepting applications for Sustainable Communities in the Fall of 2010. Applications for Sustainable Communities designation will be reviewed by an interagency panel led by DHCD and must be approved by the Governor's Smart Growth Subcabinet. Once approved -  newly designated Sustainable Communities (those that apply after June 1 -  2010) will retain their designation for a period of five years. Sustainable Communities also include designated Transit Oriented Development Zones (TOD's) and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Zones. These areas are automatically considered Sustainable Communities effective June 1 -  2010 and do not need to reapply for continued designation.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. This data layer shows the locations of NOAA tide gauges in Maryland. Knowledge of the timing and strength of tidal currents is extremely important for safe navigation in coastal waters. Tidal currents are almost always the strongest current experienced by vessels operating offshore and for considerable distances inside bays and river estuaries. Standardized procedures exist for analyzing tidal current data to separate the tidal and nontidal parameters. The tidal parameters are used to produce the National Ocean Service Tidal Current Tables. There are currently 41 tidal current reference stations where daily predictions are made based on information obtained in short-term current studies. Additional predictions are made for 2200 locations referenced to these tidal current reference stations. Predictions have varying degrees of accuracy dependant on the age of the data -  the length of the measurements and the degree of non tidal influence a given location experiences. A clear understanding of current patterns in ports and estuaries which have economical and commercial importance is vital to ensure safe navigation and help in preventing accidents. In ports where currents are dominated by non-tidal factors -  real-time current measurements are preferred.

opportunities, creating jobs, stabilizing neighborhoods and improving overall quality of life.\u200b\r\n\r\nCongress created the Community Development Block Grant Program under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program.\r\n\r\nThe Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan entitlement communities. The States and Small Cities Program provides Federal funds to the States and Puerto Rico (with the exception of Hawaii) who then distribute funds to non-entitlement counties, small cities and towns. Congress\u200b allocates funds to the program annually. The Entitlement Program receives approximately 70% of the allocation and the remaining 30% is distributed to the States and Small Cities Program.\r\n\r\nMaryland's Community Development Block Grant Program is administered by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development. The State receives an allocation from the Department of Housing and Urban Development each July.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: Some of the information may be tied to the Department\u2019s bond funded loan programs and should not be relied upon in making an investment decision.

As a member of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO) -  Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program is collecting information on how the public uses the Atlantic coast of Maryland. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  shipping -  military exercises -  sand mining -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  shipping -  military exercises -  sand mining -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Each point in Coastal Resiliency Assessment Shoreline Points represents a 250 meter segment of the Maryland coast -  including Atlantic -  Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay shorelines. The Natural Capital Project's Coastal Vulnerability model was used to calculate a Shoreline Hazard Index -  representing the relative exposure of each segment to storm-induced erosion and flooding. Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology -  elevation -  sea level rise -  wave power -  storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest -  marsh -  dune -  oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR's Community Flood Risk Areas (March -  2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Urban Land Uses: 11 Low-density residential - Detached single-family/duplex dwelling units -  yards and associated areas. Areas of more than 90 percent single-family/duplex dwelling units -  with lot sizes of less than five acres but at least one-half acre (.2 dwelling units/acre to 2 dwelling units/acre). 12 Medium-density residential - Detached single-family/duplex -  attached single-unit row housing -  yards -  and associated areas. Areas of more than 90 percent single-family/duplex units and attached single-unit row housing -  with lot sizes of less than one-half acre but at least one-eighth acre (2 dwelling units/acre to 8 dwelling units/acre). 13 High-density residential - Attached single-unit row housing -  garden apartments -  high-rise apartments/condominiums -  mobile home and trailer parks; areas of more than 90 percent high-density residential units -  with more than 8 dwelling units per acre. 14 Commercial - Retail and wholesale services. Areas used primarily for the sale of products and services -  including associated yards and parking areas. 15 Industrial - Manufacturing and industrial parks -  including associated warehouses -  storage yards -  research laboratories -  and parking areas. 16 Institutional - Elementary and secondary schools -  middle schools -  junior and senior high schools -  public and private colleges and universities -  military installations (built-up areas only -  including buildings and storage -  training -  and similar areas) -  churches -  medical and health facilities -  correctional facilities -  and government offices and facilities that are clearly separable from the surrounding land cover. 17 Extractive - Surface mining operations -  including sand and gravel pits -  quarries -  coal surface mines -  and deep coal mines. Status of activity (active vs. abandoned) is not distinguished. 18 Open urban land - Urban areas whose use does not require structures -  or urban areas where non-conforming uses characterized by open land have become isolated. Included are golf courses -  parks -  recreation areas (except areas associated with schools or other institutions) -  cemeteries -  and entrapped agricultural and undeveloped land within urban areas. 191 Large lot subdivision (agriculture) - Residential subdivisions with lot sizes of less than 20 acres but at least 5 acres -  with a dominant land cover of open fields or pasture. 192 Large lot subdivision (forest) - Residential subdivisions with lot sizes of less than 20 acres but at least 5 acres -  with a dominant land cover of deciduous -  evergreen or mixed forest. Agriculture: 21 Cropland - Field crops and forage crops. 22 Pasture - Land used for pasture -  both permanent and rotated; grass. 23 Orchards/vineyards/horticulture - Areas of intensively managed commercial bush and tree crops -  including areas used for fruit production -  vineyards -  sod and seed farms -  nurseries -  and green houses. 24 Feeding operations - Cattle feed lots -  holding lots for animals -  hog feeding lots -  poultry houses -  and commercial fishing areas (including oyster beds). 241 Feeding operations - Cattle feed lots -  holding lots for animals -  hog feeding lots -  poultry houses. 242 Agricultural building breeding and training facilities -  storage facilities -  built-up areas associated with a farmstead -  small farm ponds -  commercial fishing areas. 25 Row and garden crops - Intensively managed truck and vegetable farms and associated areas.

The Blue Infrastructure study area and extent of inventory data was defined as the 16 coastal zone counties (Anne Arundel -  Baltimore -  Calvert -  Caroline -  Cecil -  Charles -  Dorchester -  Harford -  Kent -  Prince George's -  Queen Anne's -  Somerset -  St. Mary's -  Talbot -  Wicomico -  and Worcester) and Baltimore City. Including Baltimore City makes a total of 17 designated locations based on sixteen County Boundaries and one City Boundary. Four main models were created to perform the overlay processes to calculate the Zonal Majority used to determine the total rank for all the segments. The Blue Infrastructure assessment was designed as a spatial evaluation of coastal habitat -  critical natural resources and associated human uses in the tidal waters and near-shore areas of Maryland's coastal zone. The Assessment is used to identify near-shore tidal habitat priority areas that support coastal habitats and the resources and economies that depend upon them. The Blue Infrastructure was developed through a partnership between the Maryland Department of Natural Resources' Chesapeake and Coastal Program -  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Towson University's Center for GIS.

The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on a given Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital Flood Insurance Study (FIS) database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS. This map service is a composite of Effective and Preliminary floodplain data. Q3 data is used where neither Effective or Preliminary data is available for a given community. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event -  the 0.2-percent-annual- chance flood event -  and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs) -  previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) -  flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs -  and new mapping data -  where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The purpose of creating this file was to use MesoMap to create high-resolution wind maps of the state and to provide wind resource data in a format enabling the assessment of potential wind development sites in a GIS. By combining a sophisticated numerical weather model capable of simulating large-scale wind patterns with a microscale wind flow model responsive to local terrain and surface conditions -  they enable the mapping of wind resources with much greater accuracy than has been possible in the past. In addition -  they do not require surface wind data to make accurate predictions. While on-site measurements will be required to confirm the predicted wind resource at any particular location -  mesoscale-microscale modeling can greatly reduce the time and cost required to identify and evaluate potential wind project sites. This map was created by AWS Truepower -  LLC using the MesoMap system and historical weather data. Although it is believed to represent an accurate overall picture of the wind energy resource -  estimates at any location should be confirmed by measurement.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. Traffic monitoring data is a strategic resource for SHA and Maryland's Department of Transportation. The data is essential in the planning -  design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of state highway improvement and safety programs. TMS is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991 -  which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet SHA's long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent -  continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts.The Maryland Traffic Volume Maps depict the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) at various locations on Maryland's roadways by county. Traffic Volume data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs -  located throughout Maryland. To date -  four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday -  respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority. A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers -  starting in 2006 -  to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where '0' represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014) -  '1' represents the count taken in 2013 -  '2' represents the count taken in 2012 -  '3' represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

The Program coordinates the acquisition of lands for the use of all units of DNR. Stateside POS funds are allocated to purchase land for state parks -  forests -  wildlife habitat -  natural -  scenic and cultural resources for public use. A portion of stateside funds are also dedicated to capital improvements -  critical maintenance -  and operations in state parks. Stateside POS projects are now being driven by a new Targeting System -  which uses the best scientific information available to target the program's limited funds. In the case of a project with multiple parcels -  the Identify results will indicate the total acreage and BPW amount for the project. Hence -  you will see the same acreage -  BPW amount and TEA result for each part of the project. This file consists of stateside POS projects only.

Stream Waders is the volunteer component of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS).Goals of Stream Waders are: to increase the density of sampling sites for use in stream and watershed assessments; to improve stream stewardship ethics and encourage local action to improve watershed management; to educate the local community about the relationship between land use and stream quality; and to provide quality assured information on stream quality to state -  local -  and federal agencies -  environmental organizations -  and others.Stream Waders is designed to be seamless with the MBSS and several other stream sampling programs in Maryland. MBSS samples are collected at the watershed level (8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC); about 70 square miles each) -  while Stream Waders volunteers sample at a smaller scale subwatersheds at the 12-digit HUC; about 8 square miles each). Thus -  Stream Waders data should help 'fill the gaps' left in watershed areas not sampled by MBSS. Stream Waders sample -  for the most part -  in the sameoverall watersheds each year where MBSS crews sample.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs) are lands and watersheds of high ecological value that have been identified as conservation priorities by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for natural resource protection. These areas represent the most ecologically valuable areas in the State: they are the best of the best\"\". TEAs are preferred for conservation funding through Stateside Program Open Space. This version updates the 2008 TEA layer. The first step in updating TEAs was to create an ecological baseline composed of several ecological databases which included updates of original databases and additional databases developed since 2008.The first component is the updated Green Infrastructure Assessment (circa 2010) which identifies large -  contiguous blocks (hubs) of significant forests and wetlands and their connecting corridors. The Green Infrastructure's hub and corridor network of habitat allows plant and animal migration -  reduces forest fragmentation if protected -  and provides important ecosystem services -  such as biodiversity -  cleaning air and water -  storing nutrients -  and protecting areas against storm and flood damage.The rare species and wildlife habitat component identifies areas that support Rare -  Threatened -  and Endangered Species -  rare plant and animal communities -  species of Greatest Conservation Need -  and wildlife concentrations.The aquatic life hotspots component identifies watersheds supporting freshwater stream ecosystems where conservation is needed to protect and restore areas of high aquatic biodiversity -  Tier II regulated streams -  and brook trout streams.The water quality protection component identifies sensitive lands such as forests -  wetlands -  and steep slopes where preservation is important for water quality.The coastal ecosystems component identifies Blue Infrastructure shoreline and watershed protection priorities. These are areas important for sustaining coastal and tidal ecosystems and also identifies land areas important for sustaining spawning and nursery areas for important commercial and recreational fisheries.The climate change adaptation component identifies areas important for sustaining wetlands ecosystems that are changing and moving landward in response to sea level rise.From the ecological baseline -  areas that ranked as most important for each of the components were merged to create the Targeted Ecological Areas. Lands that were developed -  as identified by the Maryland Department of Planning (2010) were removed from the TEA layer since developed lands are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding. Additionally -  lands that are in the 0 foot to 2 foot inundation zone based on the 2011 SLAMM (Maryland Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model) study performed for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City since these areas are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_FocalAreas/FeatureServer/1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS: The Spatial Data and the information therein (collectively the \"\"Data\"\") is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind either expressed implied or statutory.
